When users first arrive at your site they should be directed to a page that 
explains the issue and presents a form to sign. The form should have four 
elements: two text fields for first and last name, a hidden field for the 
signature, and a submit button. There should also be a <canvas> element 
on which users can draw their signature.


Route: 

    ("/")   GET - If signedCookie = true, redirect to ("/signed"); 
                otherwise:
                Explains the petition and presents the form.
                form: 2 text fields (first and last name), 1 hidden field to send the signature and a submit button. 
                Should also have a canvas for drawing signature. Should also have a timestamp (?)

    ("/")   POST - Receive the form data and save into a 'Database Table' named 'signatures' with these columns:
                -   id (primary)
                -   first name
                -   last name
                -   signature (dataToUrl and should be VARCHAR)

            All 4 fields are required. If not all sent OR some error, show the page again with an error message

            If success, set a cookie (signedCookie) to remember that and redirect to ("/signed")

    ("/signed") GET 
                If signedCookie = true, show a thank you page with the name of everyone the signed it;
                    otherwise: redirect to ("/")
