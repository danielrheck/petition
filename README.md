# Petition

This is a project for a petition page. A simple website in which the user can register and draw their signature to support the petition (in this example case is a petition against using cream in Carbonara ðŸ˜…)

It uses **Handlebars**, **PostgresSQL** and **ExpressJS**.

If you want to run it, you need to set a database (tables description at database/dbReset.txt)

Then you can run it:

```node server```
